In my current company, we connect to our RDS instance locally by adding my 
local machine's IP address to the RDS security group. However, this method may 
not be the most secure. A better practice for securing access to RDS is to 
use a multi-layered approach involving proxies or jump hosts. 
Here are recommended practices is that I have followed my previous organizations.

Use a Jump Host: 
Set up a secure jump host (bastion host) in a private subnet within your VPC. 
Access the RDS instance through this jump host, which should have strict security 
controls and monitoring.

Set Up a Bastion Host

Launch EC2 Instance: Create an EC2 instance in a public subnet within the same VPC as your RDS instance.

Configure Security Group:
Allow inbound SSH (port 22) from your local IP.

Ensure outbound access to RDS port (e.g., 3306 for MySQL).
Configure RDS Security Group

Security Group for RDS: Allow inbound traffic on port 3306 from the bastion hostâ€™s security group.
Access RDS Locally
Use SSH to connect to the bastion host.
#mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u your_rds_username -p
